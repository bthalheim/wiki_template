Wiki Template
===============================================
Template for setting up a personal wiki in flatfiles. Primarily to leverage "Visual Studio Code"'s rendering of markdown files.


Abstract
---------------------------------------
Using Visual Studio Code as a simple wiki as setup in this template may be beneficial for users that are wanting to start centralizing their notes but are not ready to jump into something on the level of a [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) based note taking system ( i.e. still more comfortable using folder structures for hierarchial organization. ).


Index Template 
--------------------------------------
Initial Index

* [Scratch Notes](scratch.md)
* [Markdown And KB Reference](kb.md)
* [VS Code Extensions](extensions.md)
